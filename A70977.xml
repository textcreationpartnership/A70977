            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

And in respect Parties do always offer sufficient Caution in the Bill of Suspension, to the effect the same may the more easily pass, and thereafter apply for a Supplement; whereas, if the Ordinary who past the Bill, had been acquainted, that sufficient Caution was not to be given, he would have been more strict in finding the Reasons relevant, for passing the same; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords do Ordain, that no Bills of Suspension, bearing offer of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Caution, shall be expede upon Juratory Caution; But that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Suspender shall give in his Bill, bearing, <hi>Juratory Caution,</hi> and that the Ordinary may consider the Reasons, with respect to the Juratory Caution, as if the former Bill containing the same Reasons had not been past: And the Lords Discharges the taking of Oaths in supplement by Commission; And finds that the Suspender must compear and Depone before the Ordinary on the Bills, and that no Charge to set at Liberty be past upon Juratory Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>THE Lords of Council and Session considering, that by the ninteenth Act of the third Session of his Majesties Second Parliament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Adjudications, it is Statute and Ordained, that in place of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisings, the Lords of Session, upon Processes raised before them, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of any Creditor against his Debitor, shall Adjudge and Decern to the Creditor, in satisfaction of his Debt, such part of the Debitors Estate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in Lands and other Rights, which were in use to be Apprised, as shall be worth the Principal Sum and Annualrent then resting to the Creditor, and a fifth part more, besides the Composition to the Superior, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of the Infeftment. Likeas, by the said Act it is provided and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, That in case the Debitor shall abstract the Writs and Evidents of the Lands, and other Rights to be Adjudged, and shall not produce a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Right thereof, and deliver the same, or Transumpts thereof to the Creditor, as the Lords shall judge necessary; and in case he shall not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Possession of the Lands, and other Rights to be Adjudged, and Ratifie the Decreet of Adjudication, in that case it shall be leisome to the Creditor to Adjudge all or any Right belonging to his Debitor, in the same manner, as he might have Apprised the same, conform to the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament 1661. anent the payment of Debts betwixt Debitor and Creditor, in all points, under the Reversion, and with the power competent to other Creditors, exprest in the said Act. And albeit it appears by the foresaid Act of Parliament, that where the Adjudication is special, and proceeds upon Probation of the Rental, and the Debitors production of the Writs, the Decreet ought to be for the Principal Sum, Annualrents thereof, and a fifth part more without the Penalty of the Bond; but where the Adjudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is general, in absence of the Debitor, without Probation of the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, the Decreet ought to be for the Principal Sum, Annualrent, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty (if any be) contained in the Bond or other Writ, which is the ground of the Adjudication; yet by mistake of the Clerks and their Servants, some Decreets of Adjudication have been Extracted, Adjudging the Debitors whole Lands, in satisfaction of the Principal Sum, Annualrents, Penalty, and a fifth part more. And the Lords, in some cases which have occurred before them, being unwilling hitherto to annul these Adjudications, have restricted the same to the Principal Sum, Annualrents, and Penalty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulat, contained in the Decreet; in regard the style of the Summons, concluding a fifth part more, hath given occasion to the foresaid error; but finding it expedient that the Leidges be in a certainty as to this point for the future, they declare, that if hereafter any Decreets of Adjudication, proceeding without probation of the Rental, and Adjudging the Debitors Estate in general, without restriction, shall be Extracted for a fifth part more, they will not sustain and restrict these Decreets of Adjudication, but will find the same void and null, as if they had never been pronounced. And to the end the Leidges may be certiorat herein, ordains this Act to be published at the Mercat-Cross of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>

               <p>THE Lords of Council and Session taking to their serious considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the great inconveniency of Solicitation, which creats diffidence in these who have not acquaintance or friends to recommend them, that they are not equally stated, and puts them to a necessity to go to every Lords Lodging, imagining that if they do not, that he may think he is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther despised, or distrusted, which is a slavery upon the Leidges, upon the Lords, and upon the Lawyers, who are frequently urged by their Clients to go with them, or for them to solicite the Lords: Therefore to prevent so evil a custom, which is contrary to several Acts of <hi>Sederunt,</hi> and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the practice of the most civil Nations abroad, The Lords have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and enlarged the Acts of <hi>Sederunt</hi> against Solicitation; And because they find the chief occasion of Solicitation, is the pretence that the Liedges think they are not secure that the Lords get their Informations, unless they deliver them in their own hands, and thereupon take occasion to solicite; for preventing whereof, and for easing the Liedges, themselves, and the Lawyers, They, according to the example of the most famous Judicatories abroad, have appointed Boxes for every one of the Lords, to stand on a Bank in the Session-house, from three a-Clock till seven a-Clock at night, each Box having a slit, in which the Informations or Bills may be let in, and cannot be drawn out, until the Box be opened; the Key whereof is to be kept by every Judge himself, and to be committed to no other; and each Lord is to send for his Box at seven a-Clock at night, that he may have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent time to peruse all the Informations therein, and to consider the same, and the Citations alledged in the same, whereby none of the Liedges can be put to trouble to attend any of the Lords, for giving their Informations, Bills, or Answers. Therefore the Lords do Declare, that they will receive no Informations, Bills, or Answers, in any other way, and that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the same any other way, shall be holden as Solicitation, except these Lords who are to report, who may receive the Informations of the Parties, being delivered to the Clerk of the Process, and by the Clerk, with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
